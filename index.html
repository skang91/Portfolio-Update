      <p>I graduated from Cal State University, Northridge in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. I worked at architecurual and contruction firm, a CPA firm, and a forensic accouting firm as an accountnat. Currently, I'm working for city as a finance analyst.  </p>
      <p>I enjoy working in finance and accounting field, but I always want to learn coding since I was young. I like working with computers and having fun to learn programming. I like programming because I like creating something out of nothing, making things work, and building somehting beautiful. My dream is to become a software engineer and goal is to develop my own accouting related software application. Here is my favorite quote "Wish it. Plan it. Do it."</p>
